Write about a classroom observation you have done this semester in terms of the 24 teaching techniques discussed in [_The_ _Skillful Teacher_]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) (how to make a lesson more efficient and effective). You are unlikely to have seen 24 techniques in one class. Just focus on what you DID see.

*   Describe in detail what happened in the classroom (narrative description of lesson).
*   What skills did the teacher employ to make it a good lesson? What went well?
*   Could the lesson have been improved (what would you have been done differently and why)?

Be sure to address all three points in your paper.
