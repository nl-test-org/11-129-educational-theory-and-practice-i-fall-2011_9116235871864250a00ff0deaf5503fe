This is a time to reflect on what you have learned so far, and where you find yourself now in your thinking about teaching and learning.

You can include whatever is useful to you as you write from your reflections on your own education, from your field work, from discussions in class, or from readings. It is up to you. What are you most confident about? What areas do you feel you need to focus on to become the teacher you want to be?

Expected length: 4 to 6 pages (1000â€“1500 words), but this is flexible.
